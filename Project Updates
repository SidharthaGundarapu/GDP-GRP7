1) As we have given the update to our mentor regarding our project and the submission time. 
2) The client meeting has happened last week wednesday(11/09/22) 3:00 to 3:30 pm at CH3600. We took the review from her regarding the UI pages whether she was agreeing 
with them. But the maintainence of the consistency is required in both the operating systems.
3) We are ready to submit our project to client by the end of GDP-1 course using the database of firebase and androind studio java code in the android mobile application.
But we are holding on as there  are certain discrepancies in our code that are we need to develop the RSVP fuctionality and combine the two versions of the mobile application
and the pages developed by our team. Also we are focused to create the database on the server using the PostgreSQL to maintain the consistency with the alpha team i.e. 
IOS version team.
