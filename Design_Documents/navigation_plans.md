# Navigation Details

#### Tabbed Navigation
The client requested tabbed navigation instead of the previous considered drawer layout. Below are listed some of the tabs as well as other features/pages we should be able to get to with the navigation.
 - (Tab) Profile Page
    - Shows any profile details
    - Shows a schedule of events user has RVSP'd to
 - (Tab) Current Conference Page   
    - Lets you see current conference details
    - Can navigate to events from here
    - Can RSVP to events from here
    - Can go to payment site from link here
    - Can go to sponsors from conference description area
 - (Tab) More
    - Social Media (future)
    - Settings (Maybe needs a diff. location)
    - QR Code Scanner
    - About (About Conference, About Hosts, Sponsors?)
    - Location Info (Maps/Directions/Accomodation Reccomendations)
    - Sponsors Page (independent from about)

#### Alternative Nav
We discussed that tabs should likely be different for administrators or managers (steering committee?) who log into the app.  They should help go to their special functionalities in the separate module.  We may just completely supress user functionalities in the tabs and have them available in their own "more" tab that is different from users.
