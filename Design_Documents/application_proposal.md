# Proposal - Nursing Conference Application
---
### Proposal Description
In class we had a client from NWMSU propose an idea for developing a nursing conference application.  This file contains details about what the initial propsal requested as well as some additional ideas about what it would take to do that.

### Requested Baseline Functionalities
These functionalities were described as the bare minimum required to complete this project.
 - View Conference Schedule
 - View Room Assignments
    - Scheduled speakers, breakout sessions, etc
 - Change Room Assignments
    - Times, Rooms, Titles, Speakers, etc
 - View Speaker Info
    - Keynote speakers, breakout speakers, etc

### Additional Functionalities
These functionalities were described as additional in the sense that they were not required for the baseline app, but would be appreciated and useful for the end product. While not "necessary", they are ideally still part of our goals.
 - Registration & Download (app) links for attendees

    - Attedance details on event?
 - Display a map for locations & meeting directions
    - On campus only or directions to uni too?
