### GDP 1 - Group 7

### Project Description

Our group's project is to develop a mobile application to aid with the scheduling of nursing conferences between Northwest Faculty, the local hopsital in Maryville, and prospective atendees to these conferences.  The purpose of the application is to allow the staff scheduling the conference to display and manipulate both conference and event data so that atendees/guests can view it in a clear and concise manner.
