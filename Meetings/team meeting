Team-meeting notes:
[https://webflow.com/design/nursing-symposium]
1)The above link is the demo of our Ui view for the mobile application.
2)But after the changes as per the client requirement's and to maintain
the consistency between the two OS version like Android and IOS a new design
has been finalized by both teams after the team meeting and so, it is going
to beimplemented.
3)Whereas coming to the Backend and fuctionalities part the application is still 
under development as it is a static page there is a confusion in the buttons which
to be given functionality or not.
4)The Database has a point that the demo has been tried and presented in form of the
images as attachments.But now we have an accurate schema diagram it made easy for the 
design of the database easy.As an addition we have got help from the IT cell of
the NWMSU by storing the database on a server which makes creation, storage, retrieval of
database easy.
