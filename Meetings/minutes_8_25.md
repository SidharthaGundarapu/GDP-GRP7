# Meeting Minutes - 8/25/26

### General Topics
---
The purpose of this meeting was to discuss what projects we were willing to work on, what technologies we were comfortable with, and to define some general purpose roles for our team.

### Discussion
---
We discussed an app idea for navigation campus, a restaurant style app, and the proposal presented to our class about a nursing conference app.  We felt that the nursing conference app shared many of the ideas we had originally proposed and had a much more concrete vision for what the client wanted to accomplish.  As such, we decided that the nursing conference app was the best idea and it would be our ideal outcome to negotiate for a role in this project.  The group was potentially worried about access to technologies for developing an iOS version if we were selected for it, but the group was comfortable with either iOS or Android as most of the members would be learning from scratch either way.

The group also discussed what the development process around an application would be like.  We defined some potential avenues of planning for our project before the actual development began.  The list below contains some of our ideas, though we are aware it is not all encompassing for the project goals.  Iteration on this process is required.
